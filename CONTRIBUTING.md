# Contributing to Bot Translation Project

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our bot translation project! This project utilizes [Fluent](https://projectfluent.org) for localization, enabling the bot to speak multiple languages using `.ftl` files.

## How to Contribute

### Translating

1. **Identify Missing Translations:** Check the project's root directory to see which languages are already available. Each language has its own `.ftl` file (e.g., `en.ftl` for English, `id.ftl` for Indonesian).
2. **Add or Update Translations:** If you want to add a new language, create a new `.ftl` file named with the appropriate language code. If updating an existing translation, simply modify the corresponding `.ftl` file.
3. **Follow Fluent Syntax:** Make sure your translations adhere to the [Fluent Syntax Guide](https://projectfluent.org/fluent/guide/). Fluent allows for natural-sounding translations that match the bot's voice and tone.

### Submitting Your Contributions

1. **Fork the Repository:** Create a fork of this repository on GitHub.
2. **Make Your Changes:** Work on your translations or updates in your forked version. If you're adding a new language, remember to name the file correctly according to its language code.
3. **Commit Your Changes:** Use clear commit messages that describe your contributions. If possible, reference any related issues.
4. **Open a Pull Request:** Once your translations are ready, open a pull request against the main repository. Please provide a detailed description of your work and mention how you tested the translations, if applicable.

### Best Practices

- **Human Translations Only:** We do not accept machine translations. Your contributions should be made manually to ensure accuracy and quality.
- **Collaborate with Others:** Check if someone else is working on the same language and collaborate to prevent duplicate efforts and ensure consistency.
- **Test Your Translations:** While not mandatory, testing your translations if possible can help identify issues early on.

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter any problems or have suggestions for improving the translations, please use the GitHub Issues section to let us know. Be specific in your descriptions to help us address the issue effectively.
